# Hoisting

## Points to remember

- Its a process where interpreter moves the declaration of functions, variables or classes to the top of their scope, prior to the execution of code.

- Functions are hoisted

- Variables are hosited - (JavaScript only hoists declarations, not initializations!)
- Variables declared with Var are hosited (and default initialisation is 'undefined')

- Let and Const are hoisted - (but unlike var its not initialised with a default value that is why it gives reference error)

### Var variables

- Var variables are hoisted (can used before define it )
- function scoped
-
